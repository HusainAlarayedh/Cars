<p> Toyota has announced that they will stop using the V8 Engines on their Land Cruisers. Instead, the Land Cruisers will be replaced with a twin-turbo 
V6s improving the efficiency. The new LC300 Land Cruiser will also come with a GR Sport version offering a better design and an enhanced suspension improving its desert off-roading abilities. 
<p> <abbr title="Ebrahim Kanoo Racing">EKR</abbr> did one of the dyno tests with the new LC300 Land Cruiser GR Sport to check the capabilities of the new engine and Toyota's claims. According to Toyota, the horsepower generated by the Land Cruiser should be about 368hp. 
The tuners found out that the engine produced 370 horsepower while running on pump gas (standard fuel). Therefore, the results of the dyno test proved that the claims were correct. </p>
<p>In the second dyno test, race gas was used (Octane Unleaded), it was seen that the car generated 377 horsepower. </p>

<img src= "images/G-Class.jpg" alt = "Mercedes G63" width= "240" height = "180" class="float-img"> 
<p> Mercdes has announced that they stopped taking orders on the G-Class models. Specifically, the G500 and G63 models. According to the rumours, this is due to the shortage of car parts mercedes is currently experiencing. To digress, this is no new thing as mercedes has experienced the same thing a couple years ago with the 2017 G63. 
</p> 
<p> The G-Class buyers have been waiting a long time to get their hands on one of these cars. Some buyers have been waiting for 16 months for their cars to arrive which angered car enthusiasts and buyers. </p> 
<p>  If you really want to get the mercedes g-class, you can purchase an imported G63 or G500 from Europe as they are still available out there, but the price will be more expensive. </p>
